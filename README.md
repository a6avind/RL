# Creating a reflective loader in C#

I was following [Jean's](https://twitter.com/Jean_Maes_1994) Adversary village [workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6LOQQiNjj0) to learn C# and reflective loaders.

Documentation that he has is available [here](https://jfmaes-1.gitbook.io/reflection-workshop).
